These are the plots of the data recorded by the accelerometer whilst
the phone undergoes translation. First the phone is moved quickly in
the x direction, then quickly in the y direction, then quickly in the
z direction. Then the phone is unmoved for a period of time. Finally
the first part is repeated but with slower movement.
